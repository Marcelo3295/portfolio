description: I have worked with HTML and CSS for over a decade, producing responsive markup and styles with an emphasis on accessibility and performance. I have an in-depth knowledge of the CSS spec and have worked with flexbox and grid. I can produce showpiece animations using only CSS animations. I have used both pre-processors Sass and Less.
