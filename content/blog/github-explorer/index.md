This is one of the projects developed in [Go Stack](https://rocketseat.com.br/gostack), the Bootcamp of [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br).

In this project I create an application that makes a request for the Github API and shows the searched repositories.

## Requirements

- Use Typescript;
- Use Styled-Components;
- Replicate Layout;
