This is my first project in [Gama Experience](https://gama.academy/experience/), the Bootcamp of GamaAcademy.

In this project I create a landing page using only HTML and CSS with 6 news about COVID-19.

## Requirements

- Only have separate HTML and CSS files;
- Have the following pages: Home, About, Contact and Learn more
- Have at least one type of news item: audio, video and text;
- Be hard coded (your own code, without using Bootstrap and drag-and-drop tools like Wix);
- Be in a repository on GitHub.
